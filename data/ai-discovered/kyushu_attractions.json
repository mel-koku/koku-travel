The shrine attracts over 10 million visitors annually, particularly students praying for academic success.\n\nThe current main hall dates back to 1591 and is designated as a National Important Cultural Property, preserving magnificent Azuchi-Momoyama period architecture. The grounds feature a heart-shaped pond crossed by three drum bridges, representing the past, present, and future. The legendary 'flying plum tree' (Tobiume) stands to the right of the main hall, said to have flown from Kyoto to reunite with Michizane in exile.\n\nThe shrine is particularly beautiful during plum blossom season (late February to mid March) when the 6,000 plum trees bloom. The approach is lined with shops selling umegae mochi, a traditional grilled rice cake stamped with a plum blossom pattern.",

The most iconic experience is renting a rowboat (30 minutes, ¥4,100 for up to 3 people) and paddling directly beneath the waterfall—a bucket-list activity for photographers and couples alike. There's also a 1km nature trail along the rim offering panoramic viewpoints.\n\nBeyond its natural beauty, Takachiho holds deep spiritual significance in Japanese mythology. According to legend, this is where the deity Ninigi-no-mikoto descended from heaven to establish the Japanese imperial line. The nearby Takachiho Shrine and Amano Iwato Shrine add cultural depth to the visit.",

The main keep was destroyed by fire during this conflict and reconstructed in 1960, housing a museum with artifacts from the Kato and Hosokawa clans.

The park is particularly beautiful during cherry blossom season (late March-early April) when approximately 1,000 trees burst into bloom, and again in August during the summer fireworks festival.\n\nAdjacent to the park is the Fukuoka Art Museum, featuring an impressive collection of modern art including works by Dalí, Miró, and Japanese masters, plus the famous Kofukuji Urn. The traditional Japanese garden (separate admission) offers meticulously landscaped scenery with tea houses where visitors can enjoy matcha. Nearby, the ruins of Fukuoka Castle on Maizuru Hill provide additional walking trails and historical interest.",

    "description": "Nanzoin Temple is famous for housing the Nehanzo—the world's largest bronze reclining Buddha statue, an awe-inspiring sight at 41 meters long, 11 meters high, and weighing 300 tons (about the same as the Statue of Liberty). Completed in 1995, the statue depicts Buddha entering Nirvana and is flanked by numerous smaller Buddhist deities.\n\nThe temple was originally located in Wakayama Prefecture but was relocated to Sasaguri in 1899. It serves as the first temple on the Sasaguri Pilgrimage, a mini version of the famous Shikoku 88 Temple Pilgrimage that includes 88 Buddhist temples throughout the Sasaguri area. This pilgrimage was established 180 years ago and can be completed in a few days rather than the weeks required for Shikoku.\n\nBeyond the giant Buddha, the temple complex includes the Shichifukujin Tunnel—a passage said to grant wishes when you encounter statues of the Seven Gods of Good Fortune. The grounds feature beautiful autumn foliage, numerous small shrines and chapels housing over 500 Buddhist deities, and a serene tea room. The temple is easily accessible as a day trip from Fukuoka.",

Unlike other national museums that focus primarily on fine arts, this museum emphasizes the cultural exchange between Japan and Asia through history, reflecting Kyushu's role as the gateway between Japan and the continent.\n\nThe striking modern building, designed by architect Kikutake Kiyonori, features a wave-like glass and steel structure that appears to float amid the forested hillside. It covers 15,000 square meters and houses approximately 1,200 cultural artifacts in its permanent exhibition, chronologically tracing Asian cultural history from prehistoric times through the Edo period.\n\nSpecial exhibitions showcase treasures on loan from museums worldwide. The 'Ajippa' hands-on exhibition space allows visitors to experience Asian cultures through touchable replicas and traditional costumes. The museum connects directly to Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine via a pleasant forest path and escalator tunnel, making it easy to combine both attractions.",

The grounds include the graves of the Kuroda clan, former feudal lords of Fukuoka. The temple can be easily combined with nearby Kushida Shrine (a 5-minute walk) for a comprehensive cultural experience in central Hakata.",

Today, approximately 4,000 people live on its slopes, adapting to life alongside this dynamic geological feature.\n\nThe volcano dominates Kagoshima's skyline and is reached by a frequent 15-minute ferry from the city—a scenic journey offering spectacular views. On the island, visitors can explore several observation points: Yunohira Observatory at 373m offers close views of the active Minamidake crater; Arimura Lava Observatory shows the moonscape created by the 1914 eruption; and the Kurokami Buried Torii preserves a shrine gate buried up to its crossbar by volcanic debris.\n\nSakurajima Dinosaur Park is a family-friendly attraction with dinosaur-shaped playground equipment and cherry trees. The island also offers onsen experiences, including the beachside Shirahama Onsen with natural foot baths. Sakurajima's unique giant radishes and tiny tangerines, grown in mineral-rich volcanic soil, are local specialties.",

The experience is particularly memorable at sunset when the city transforms from day to night, and the tower itself is illuminated with seasonal light displays—hearts for Valentine's Day, Christmas themes in December, and special patterns for local events.\n\nThe tower complex includes restaurants, a souvenir shop, and a lover's sanctuary on the observation floor where couples can purchase heart-shaped padlocks to secure to the railings. The surrounding Momochi Seaside Park area offers beaches, the Robosquare robot museum, and access to the PayPay Dome (home of the Softbank Hawks baseball team).",

The signature dish is Hakata tonkotsu ramen—rich, creamy pork bone broth with thin noodles—but stalls also serve yakitori (grilled chicken skewers), oden (hot pot), gyoza, mentaiko (spicy cod roe), and local specialties. Cold beer and sake flow freely.\n\nThe experience is as much about atmosphere as food. Sitting elbow-to-elbow with locals and fellow travelers, chatting with the stall owner, and watching dishes prepared just feet away creates memorable moments. Many stalls have been family-run for generations, each with its own specialty and loyal following. Peak hours are 8pm-midnight; most stalls close around 2am. Note that some stalls may charge a 'seating fee' (around ¥500) separate from food costs.",

Year-round, visitors can see these impressive floats displayed on the shrine grounds—the 10-meter tall kazariyama (decorative float) changes annually.\n\nThe shrine grounds are compact but filled with interesting features: a 1,000-year-old ginkgo tree designated a natural monument, a unique 'crane well' whose water is said to bring longevity, and anchor stones from a Mongol invasion ship. The entrance gate features 12 wooden zodiac carvings. Kushida Shrine sits conveniently in central Hakata, within walking distance of Canal City and Tochoji Temple.",
