After losing its military significance, it was converted into a public park in the 1910s and is now designated as a Special Historic Site.\n\nToday, over 1,600 cherry trees line the moats, making it one of Hokkaido's premier hanami spots in early May. The adjacent 107-meter Goryokaku Tower offers stunning aerial views of the perfect star shape.

The market atmosphere is lively, with shopkeepers calling out to passersby.\n\nSeveral small restaurants within the market serve spectacular kaisendon (seafood rice bowls) and sushi at reasonable prices—a perfect Hokkaido breakfast experience. Popular spots open early (around 7 AM) and can get crowded by mid-morning. The market is closed during New Year (January 1-3) and operates with varying hours by individual shop.",

    "description": "Hakodate Morning Market (Asaichi) is one of Japan's most celebrated fish markets, located immediately adjacent to Hakodate Station. Established shortly after World War II, the market now comprises approximately 250 shops spread across several blocks, opening as early as 5 AM to serve the freshest catch.\n\nThe market is particularly famous for live squid (ika), a Hakodate specialty. Many restaurants feature 'ika-tsuri' (squid fishing) where diners catch their own squid from tanks, which is then prepared as sashimi within minutes—so fresh it's still moving. Hairy crab, sea urchin, scallops, and salmon roe are other highlights.\n\nNumerous small eateries serve spectacular kaisendon (seafood rice bowls) at very reasonable prices, making this one of Japan's best breakfast destinations. The Donburi Yokocho area has around 20 restaurants specializing in these dishes. Beyond seafood, the market sells Hokkaido melons, dairy products, and regional vegetables. Activity peaks between 6-8 AM; by early afternoon, many shops close.",

Built in 1878 as the drill hall for Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University), the distinctively American-style wooden building represents Sapporo's pioneering heritage.\n\nThe clock mechanism, manufactured by Howard & Co. of Boston, was installed in 1881 and has been operating continuously for over 140 years—one of the oldest functioning tower clocks in Japan. The bell chimes on the hour, a beloved sound that echoes through central Sapporo.\n\nThe museum inside documents Sapporo's development history and the building's significance. Exhibits explain the connection to William S. Clark, the American educator whose famous departing words 'Boys, be ambitious!' remain an inspirational motto. While the tower may seem small compared to surrounding modern buildings, its historical importance and architectural charm make it a must-visit. The most photogenic views are from the small park opposite the building.",

Winter (December-March) is the best time to observe these majestic birds at designated feeding stations and observation centers, where they perform elaborate courtship dances.\n\nThe park offers various viewing platforms and observation decks, including the popular Hosooka Observatory and Kottaro Wetland Observatory, providing panoramic views across the endless marshland and Mount Oakan in the distance. Canoe tours on the Kushiro River offer intimate encounters with nature, while the Norokko scenic train provides a leisurely way to appreciate the landscape.

Play Mountain and its surrounding areas offer spaces for children's activities.\n\nThe design philosophy treats the entire park as a single sculpture, emphasizing the relationship between human creativity and nature. Cherry blossoms bloom in spring, while summer brings vibrant green landscapes. The park is free to enter and offers bicycle rentals for exploring its vast grounds. Evening illuminations and fountain shows create magical atmospheres during warmer months.",
