    "description": "Held in early November, the 'Usuki Take-akari' transforms the historic castle town into a sea of soft light. Approximately 30,000 bamboo lanterns (take-dōrō) are placed along the streets and in front of samurai residences and temples.\n\nThe event commemorates the local history and the legendary figure 'Ma-no-Choja.' The soft, warm light creates a quiet and reverent atmosphere, perfect for exploring the well-preserved Edo-period architecture of Usuki. It is widely considered one of the most beautiful and peaceful bamboo lantern festivals in Japan.",
