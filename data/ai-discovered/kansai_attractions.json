Fox statues, considered messengers of Inari, can be found throughout the grounds. The hike to the summit takes about 2-3 hours and offers stunning views over Kyoto, with many atmospheric sub-shrines and rest stops along the way.\n\nUnlike most shrines, Fushimi Inari is open 24 hours and is particularly magical at dawn or dusk when crowds thin and lanterns illuminate the gates. It's consistently ranked as Japan's most popular tourist attraction for foreign visitors.",

Each floor of the pavilion showcases a different architectural style: Heian aristocratic, samurai warrior, and Chinese Zen.

    "short_description": "A modern museum showcasing Osaka's history from ancient times through life-size dioramas and exhibits with views of Osaka Castle.",
    "description": "The Osaka Museum of History offers a comprehensive journey through the city's rich past, from its origins as the ancient capital of Naniwa to its modern incarnation as Japan's commercial hub. Located in a striking modern building adjacent to NHK broadcasting, the museum features panoramic views of nearby Osaka Castle from its upper floors.\n\nThe museum is built over the excavated remains of the 7th-century Naniwa-no-Miya Palace, which visitors can view in the basement. Exhibits are arranged in descending chronological order starting from the 10th floor, featuring remarkable life-size reconstructions including a Naniwa Palace ceremonial hall, medieval Osaka streets, and Edo-period kabuki theater complete with costumed mannequins.\n\nInteractive elements allow visitors to try on replica historical costumes and handle archaeological artifacts. English audio guides enhance the experience. The museum's location makes it perfect to combine with Osaka Castle exploration – the castle views from the 10th floor provide excellent photo opportunities, especially during cherry blossom season.",
