    "description": "Shinjuku Minamirumi (a portmanteau of 'South' and 'Illumination') covers the Southern Terrace and the surrounding skyscrapers. The theme usually involves 'jewel' colors, with the walkway transformed into a sparkling promenade. It is a highly accessible spot for those transiting through Shinjuku Station.\n\nThe display often features interactive elements, such as sensors that change the light colors when people pass by or touch certain installations. It creates a festive, modern atmosphere in one of the world's busiest commercial districts.",
