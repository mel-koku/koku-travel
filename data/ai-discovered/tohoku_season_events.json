The park is home to over 2,600 cherry trees, including some of the oldest Somei Yoshino trees in Japan. The event is famous for its 'Hanaikada' (flower rafts), where fallen petals completely carpet the castle moats in pink.\n\nAt night, the trees and the castle keep are illuminated, creating a surreal reflection on the water. Visitors can also enjoy rental boats in the moat to see the blossoms from a unique perspective. It is widely considered the premier cherry blossom viewing experience in Northern Japan.",

It features massive, hand-painted washi paper floats depicting mythical figures and kabuki actors, which are illuminated from within and paraded through the streets. The parade is accompanied by 'Haneto' dancers who jump and chant 'Rassera!' to the beat of taiko drums.\n\nHistory suggests the festival originated from the Tanabata 'floating of lanterns' tradition, intended to wash away sleepiness (nebutai) before the harvest. On the final night, the floats are placed on boats in the harbor for a sea parade accompanied by a massive fireworks display.",

The area is also part of the Naruko Onsen village, making it a perfect spot to combine foliage viewing with a soak in traditional hot springs.",

Hundreds of zelkova trees lining the Jozenji-dori and Aoba-dori avenues are draped in over 600,000 warm-toned LED lights. The effect is a 'tunnel of light' that transforms the city center into a winter wonderland.\n\nA highlight of the event is the 'Starlight Wink,' where all lights are briefly turned off and then re-lit simultaneously several times a night. There is also a 'Santa's Forest' parade featuring hundreds of participants in holiday costumes. This event has been a symbol of Sendai's resilience and community spirit since it began in 1986.",

The tradition dates back over 450 years and is a hallmark of the snowy 'Ura-Nippon' (Back-of-Japan) culture.",
