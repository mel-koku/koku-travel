It is a 'strolling garden' featuring six ponds and thirteen landscaped hills. In late March, approximately 300 cherry trees, mostly Somei Yoshino, come into bloom. The garden hosts a special night opening where the trees are artfully lit, creating reflections on the water that are often cited as some of the most beautiful in the country.\n\nThe illumination highlights the 'borrowed scenery' of Mt. Shiun, which serves as a dark backdrop to the glowing pink blossoms. Visitors can take traditional wasen boat rides at night during this period, offering a unique perspective of the flowers from the pond's surface. The contrast between the meticulously pruned pine trees—some over 300 years old—and the ethereal cherry blossoms is a highlight of the season.",

The festival is characterized by the chant: 'The dancers are fools, the watchers are fools; if both are fools, you might as well dance!'\n\nGroups of dancers known as 'ren' perform through the streets to the accompaniment of lute, taiko drums, shinobue flutes, and kane bells. Women wear traditional yukata and woven straw hats (amigasa), while men often perform a more vigorous, low-crouched dance. The energy of the festival is infectious, and the entire city center is transformed into a massive outdoor stage for four days.",

    "description": "From late November to early January, the Horinouchi Park at the base of Matsuyama Castle is transformed by thousands of blue and white LED lights. The display is designed to represent the 'milky way' flowing through the city. The main attraction is the 'Light Tunnel,' which stretches across the park's walking paths.\n\nThe most striking feature of this illumination is the sight of the original Matsuyama Castle tower lit up on the hill above the modern light display. It bridges the gap between the city's ancient history and modern festive celebrations. The area is also close to the Okaido shopping district, making it a convenient and popular spot for evening walks and seasonal photography.",

In mid-August, the temple holds the 'Manto-e' (Ten Thousand Lanterns) festival. Thousands of glass lanterns are placed throughout the vast temple grounds, creating a sea of light as the sun sets.\n\nThe lanterns are lit as an offering and a prayer for ancestors. The sight of the temple's massive pagoda and ancient camphor trees illuminated by flickering candles is deeply spiritual and peaceful. Visitors can participate by lighting their own lanterns. The event also features traditional Buddhist chanting and music, making it a quintessential Japanese summer evening experience.",

    "description": "Every April, the town of Kotohira hosts 'Shikoku Konpira Kabuki Oshiba' at the Kanamaru-za, which was built in 1835 and is the oldest surviving Kabuki theater in Japan. Famous actors from Tokyo and Osaka travel here to perform in the traditional style. The theater uses no electricity for the performance; the stage is lit by natural light through windows, and all stage effects (like the revolving stage) are operated manually by people below the floorboards.\n\nThe event is highly prestigious and tickets are famously difficult to obtain. The theater itself is a National Important Cultural Property. Seeing Kabuki in such an authentic, intimate setting—where the audience sits on tatami mats—is a journey back to the Edo period. The town celebrates the arrival of the actors with a grand parade through the streets.",

Famous artists decorate hotel rooms, public squares, and even the exterior of the historic bathhouse. These events often feature night-time projections and light art that change with the seasons.\n\nThe festival aims to merge the 3,000-year history of the springs with modern creativity. Visitors can take an 'art stroll' in their yukata, moving between various sculptures and galleries. These events often run for several months, with special limited-time performances and workshops that make the district feel like a living museum. It is a unique way to experience traditional bathhouse culture through a modern lens.",
