The iconic Dogo Onsen Honkan, a three-story wooden bathhouse built in 1894, was the first public bathhouse in Japan to be designated as a National Important Cultural Property. Its labyrinthine interior of stairways, passages, and rooms has served as inspiration for the bathhouse in Hayao Miyazaki's beloved animated film 'Spirited Away.'\n\nThe bathhouse offers multiple bathing experiences at different price levels, from the basic Kami no Yu bath to the more exclusive Tama no Yu with private relaxation rooms. Visitors can also tour the Yushinden, a special bathroom reserved for the Imperial Family. The surrounding area features a charming shopping arcade, traditional ryokan inns, and the nearby Ishiteji Temple, making it a complete cultural destination.\n\nThe area has been a frequent destination for Japan's most prestigious guests, including the Imperial Family. After bathing, visitors traditionally stroll through the Dogo Haikara Dori shopping arcade in yukata robes, enjoying local specialties like 'Botchan dango' sweet dumplings and mikan citrus products.",

Construction began in 1602 under Kato Yoshiaki and took over 20 years to complete, making it one of the longest castle construction projects in Japanese history.\n\nThe castle complex is remarkably well-preserved, with 21 buildings designated as Important Cultural Properties. The main keep, rebuilt in 1854 after being destroyed by lightning, features multiple wings and defensive structures including the only surviving watchtower-style double turret in Japan. Inside, visitors can explore exhibits about Matsuyama's feudal history, view samurai armor and weapons, and experience the castle's ingenious defensive architecture.\n\nAccess to the hilltop castle is convenient via ropeway or chairlift, with the single-chair lift being a particularly pleasant and popular experience. Shiroyama Park at the base features approximately 200 cherry trees, making this one of Japan's Top 100 Cherry Blossom Spots, especially beautiful from late March to early April.",

The shrine grounds display Buddhist and Shinto architectural elements, reflecting its pre-Meiji history as a combined religious site. Notable features include the Ema Hall displaying pictures of ships, battleships, and even space rockets whose crews sought the shrine's protection.\n\nThe approach is lined with souvenir shops selling traditional items like walking sticks, yellow 'happiness' amulets (Kofuku no Kiiroi Omamori), and fan-shaped 'kamiyo ame' candies. The area is also famous for Sanuki udon noodles. From the main hall and inner shrine, visitors are rewarded with sweeping panoramic views over the Sanuki Plain and Seto Inland Sea.",

Some say it was built by members of the defeated Heike (Taira) clan who fled to this remote valley after losing the Gempei War in 1185, creating bridges that could be easily cut if enemies approached. Others attribute it to the Buddhist monk Kobo Daishi who built it to help local villagers. At one time, 13 such bridges spanned the valley, but only three remain today.\n\nThe Iya Valley itself is characterized by steep mountain slopes, deep rocky gorges, and isolated hillside hamlets that preserve traditional Japanese rural life. Nearby attractions include the Biwa-no-taki waterfall, hot spring hotels, and the more remote Oku-Iya Double Vine Bridges deeper in the valley. The area is also famous for local specialties like Iya soba noodles and 'deko mawashi' skewers.",

When the waters of the Seto Inland Sea collide with the opposing Pacific Ocean currents in the 1.3-kilometer-wide strait during high and low tide, they create powerful whirlpools reaching up to 20 meters in diameter. The current speed can reach 20 km/h during spring tides, making it one of the world's three greatest tidal currents alongside the Strait of Messina and Seymour Narrows.\n\nThe whirlpools occur roughly every six hours and can typically be seen once in the morning and afternoon for one to two hours each. They are largest during spring tides when the sun, earth, and moon align, and tend to be more dramatic in spring and autumn. It's essential to check the whirlpool schedules before visiting, as conditions vary significantly.\n\nVisitors can experience the whirlpools from sightseeing boats that get right up next to them, some featuring underwater viewing windows. Alternatively, the Uzu-no-Michi Walkway, built under the Onaruto Bridge, features glass floor panels suspended 45 meters above the strait, offering a bird's-eye view of the swirling waters.

    "description": "The Shimanto River is celebrated as Japan's last clear stream, flowing 196 kilometers through the mountains of southwestern Kochi Prefecture to the Pacific Ocean. Unlike Japan's other major rivers, the Shimanto has no dams along its main course, preserving its pristine waters and traditional riverside lifestyle. The river's clarity and natural beauty have made it a symbol of environmental preservation and a destination for those seeking unspoiled Japanese nature.\n\nThe river is famous for its 47 'chinkabashi' or submersible bridges, distinctive low bridges built without railings that are designed to submerge during floods rather than resist the water's force. These bridges create picturesque scenes as cyclists and pedestrians cross the clear waters, and have become iconic symbols of the region. The most famous is Sada Chinkabashi, often featured in photographs and travel media.\n\nThe Shimanto offers excellent opportunities for water activities including canoeing, kayaking, and river cruises aboard traditional 'yakatabune' houseboats. Fishing for sweetfish (ayu) using traditional methods is a popular summer activity. The river valley is also known for its fireflies in early summer. Riverside villages maintain traditional industries including seaweed harvesting and river fishing, offering visitors a glimpse into a way of life increasingly rare in modern Japan.",

    "description": "Ishiteji Temple is Matsuyama's most famous temple and the 51st stop on the Shikoku 88 Temple Pilgrimage. Located just a 20-minute walk from Dogo Onsen, it makes an excellent cultural addition to any hot spring visit. The temple's Niomon gate is designated a National Treasure, and numerous other buildings and artifacts have received Important Cultural Property status. The name 'Ishiteji' means 'Temple of the Stone Hand,' referencing a legend involving Kobo Daishi.\n\nWhat sets Ishiteji apart from other pilgrimage temples is its mysterious cave system. A fascinating tunnel leads to a secondary temple complex, creating an otherworldly experience as visitors pass statues, stone carvings, and Buddhist imagery in the dimly lit passages. The main cave passage opens to a mountainside area filled with colorful statues, memorial stones, and small shrines scattered across the hillside in a somewhat chaotic but atmospheric arrangement.\n\nThe spacious temple grounds feature a three-storied pagoda, multiple halls, and an eclectic collection of religious artifacts accumulated over centuries. The approach is lined with small shops and restaurants, and the temple has a unique atmosphere blending traditional Buddhism with folk religious elements. The temple is known for its connections to henro pilgrimage legend, as this is where the famous story of Emon Saburo and the origin of the pilgrimage tradition is said to have occurred.",

    "description": "The Uzu-no-Michi (Whirlpool Road) is a 450-meter walkway built beneath the Onaruto Bridge that spans the Naruto Strait. Suspended 45 meters above the churning waters, this enclosed promenade leads visitors to an observation area featuring glass floor panels that provide vertigo-inducing views directly down to the famous Naruto Whirlpools. The experience of watching massive whirlpools form and spin beneath your feet is both thrilling and unforgettable.\n\nThe walkway takes advantage of the bridge's unique construction, converting the lower deck maintenance passage into a public attraction. Along the way, informational displays explain the science behind the whirlpool phenomenon and the bridge's engineering. The observation room at the end offers panoramic views of the strait, Awaji Island, and the surrounding coastline, in addition to the dramatic glass-floor sections.\n\nFor the best experience, visitors should time their visit to coincide with the whirlpool schedule, as the vortexes form during the tidal changes approximately every six hours. The walkway offers a completely different perspective from the boat tours, allowing visitors to see multiple whirlpools simultaneously and appreciate their full scale from above. Combined with nearby attractions like the Otsuka Museum of Art and Naruto Park's observation decks, it makes for a comprehensive exploration of this remarkable natural phenomenon.",

    "description": "Zentsuji Temple holds extraordinary significance as the birthplace of Kobo Daishi (Kukai), the founder of Shingon Buddhism and the spiritual heart of the Shikoku Pilgrimage. As Temple #75 on the 88-temple circuit, it is one of the pilgrimage's most important destinations. The temple's name is even used for the city that has grown around it, reflecting its central role in regional identity. The extensive grounds are divided into the Eastern Precinct (Toin), containing the Main Hall and birthplace sacred sites, and the Western Precinct (Saiin), housing the five-story pagoda.\n\nThe temple's most moving experience is the 'Kaidan Meguri' (underground pilgrimage), a pitch-black passage beneath the Main Hall where visitors walk approximately 100 meters in complete darkness while touching the wall and chanting. The passage symbolizes traversing the realm of the Buddha and emerges near the spot where Kobo Daishi was born in 774 CE. This powerful spiritual experience is unique among the 88 temples and draws pilgrims seeking deep connection with the great master.\n\nThe temple complex spans 45,000 square meters and includes numerous Important Cultural Properties, including a five-story pagoda reconstructed in 1845. The Treasury Museum houses religious artifacts, paintings, and items associated with Kobo Daishi. Throughout the year, the temple hosts various ceremonies and festivals, particularly on Kobo Daishi's memorial day (March 21), drawing thousands of devotees.",

    "description": "The Oku-Iya Niju Kazurabashi (Double Vine Bridges) are a pair of suspension bridges deep in the remote upper reaches of the Iya Valley, approximately 30 km from the main Iya Kazurabashi. These 'husband and wife' bridges offer a quieter, more authentic experience than their famous counterpart, with far fewer visitors and a more pristine natural setting. The male bridge spans 42 meters while the female bridge measures 22 meters, both made from woven mountain vines and rebuilt every three years.\n\nWhat makes this location special is the wild-pulling ropeway (Yaen) nearby – a simple wooden platform on ropes that visitors can pull themselves across the river using their own strength. This thrilling experience adds to the adventurous atmosphere of the deep valley. The surrounding area features hiking trails leading to hidden waterfalls, traditional farmhouses, and the famous Scarecrow Village (Nagoro), where lifelike scarecrows populate an otherwise nearly abandoned hamlet.\n\nAccess to the Oku-Iya bridges requires a car or joining a tour, as public transportation is extremely limited. The journey along narrow, winding mountain roads is part of the adventure, passing through landscapes that feel unchanged from centuries past. The isolation has helped preserve traditional ways of life, and visitors may encounter thatched-roof farmhouses, terraced fields, and the descendants of Heike warriors who reportedly fled here after their defeat in the 12th century.",

Born in Kochi, Dr. Makino discovered and named over 1,500 plant species during his lifetime and created detailed botanical illustrations that remain references today. The garden houses approximately 3,000 plant species, including many named or discovered by the renowned botanist.\n\nThe garden is designed to showcase the rich plant diversity of Kochi Prefecture, which spans from subtropical coastal areas to alpine zones. Themed areas include a conservatory with tropical plants, traditional herb gardens, and naturalistic woodland walks. The main building, designed by architect Makoto Sei Watanabe, houses a museum with exhibits about Dr. Makino's life, his botanical illustrations, and the history of Japanese botany. The architecture seamlessly integrates with the natural landscape.\n\nThe garden gained renewed international attention when NHK's 2023 morning drama 'Ranman' told the story of Dr. Makino's life, drawing visitors eager to learn about this remarkable self-taught scientist who began studying plants as a child and continued his research until age 94. The garden is particularly beautiful during spring when various wildflowers bloom, and autumn when the hillside forest displays vibrant foliage. A restaurant and gift shop offer local products including botanical-themed items.",

The main arcade connects Takamatsu Station to Ritsurin Garden, making it both a practical thoroughfare and a shopping destination. Protected from rain and summer heat by its roof, the arcade bustles with activity from morning to evening, offering a perfect blend of traditional shops, modern retailers, and countless dining options.\n\nThe arcade is particularly famous for its concentration of Sanuki udon restaurants, as Kagawa Prefecture is the undisputed udon capital of Japan. Visitors can find dozens of udon shops ranging from traditional standing-only establishments to more elaborate restaurants, each with their own style and devoted following. The thick, chewy noodles are typically served in hot or cold preparations with various toppings. Sampling multiple shops is encouraged, as portions are small and prices extremely reasonable.\n\nBeyond udon, the arcade offers everything from traditional crafts, including Kagawa lacquerware and Marugame fans, to fashion boutiques, electronics stores, and souvenir shops. The historic Lion-dori section features charming architecture and traditional stores. The arcade connects to several covered side streets and the Sunport waterfront area, allowing for hours of exploration. Evening brings a lively atmosphere as restaurants and izakayas open for dinner and drinks.",
