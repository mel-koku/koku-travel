The site includes the iconic Shureimon gate, which is featured on Japan's 2,000 yen note.\n\nDesignated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 as part of the Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu, the castle was tragically destroyed by fire in October 2019. Visitors can currently observe the valuable reconstruction process, with the main hall expected to be fully restored by autumn 2026.",

When sunlight enters through the cave opening and reflects off the white sandy bottom, the water appears to glow an intense, almost electric blue. The phenomenon is most vivid during morning hours when the sun angle is optimal.\n\nNumerous tour operators offer guided snorkeling and diving trips to the cave, suitable for beginners and experienced divers alike. The surrounding waters are rich in marine life including tropical fish, sea cucumbers, and occasionally sea turtles. Access to the cave is possible by swimming from shore or by boat, with the stairs at Maeda Point being the most common entry point.",
