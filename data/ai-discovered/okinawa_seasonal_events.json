Visiting during this time allows you to see the unique architectural style of Ryukyuan 'gusuku' (castles) while enjoying a climate that feels like a mild spring. **Pros:** Stunning night photography and unique flower species. **Cons:** The site involves steep, uneven stone steps which can be slippery at night.",

    "description": "Located at the ANA InterContinental Manza Beach Resort, this massive inflatable obstacle course on the ocean is a summer staple. It includes slides, trampolines, and climbing walls all floating on the emerald water. It typically opens in March (Okinawa's beach opening season) and closes in November.\n\nIt’s a major draw for families with kids. The resort area itself is famous for the nearby 'Manzamo' scenic cliff. **Pros:** Incredibly fun and safe for families. **Cons:** Can be very expensive for a family and often has 60-minute time limits during peak hours.",
