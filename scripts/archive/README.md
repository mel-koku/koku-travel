# Archived Scripts

This directory contains scripts that were used for one-time debugging, migration, or data analysis tasks. These scripts are kept for reference but are not actively maintained or used in regular workflows.

## Archived Scripts

- **`debug-desc-match.ts`** - One-time debug script for matching location descriptions between database and enriched data
- **`debug-ids.ts`** - One-time debug script for debugging location ID generation and matching
- **`debug-hokkaido.ts`** - One-time debug script for inspecting Hokkaido scraper HTML structure

## Why Archived?

These scripts were created for specific debugging or migration tasks that have been completed. They are preserved here for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding past data processing workflows
- Potential reuse of patterns/logic

## Note

If you need to run these scripts, be aware they may:
- Reference outdated data structures
- Use deprecated APIs or methods
- Require manual updates to work with current codebase

Consider creating new scripts based on current patterns rather than modifying these archived ones.
