# Roadmap

## Priority 3: Medium (Pending)

- [ ] **Trip sharing feature** - Allow users to share itineraries

## Priority 4: Low (Pending)

- [ ] **Mobile app/PWA** - Progressive web app or native mobile
- [ ] **Real-time collaboration** - Multiple users editing same trip
- [ ] **User review system** - Reviews and ratings for locations

## Technical Debt

- [ ] **Remove deprecated locationDetailsStore.ts** - Replace with React Query hooks (target: v2.0)
- [ ] **Fix itinerary/refine schema mismatch** - Zod schema vs VALID_REFINEMENT_TYPES

## Not Planned

- **Weather integration** - Real-time forecasts only useful for trips within 5-7 days. Historical/seasonal data would require different approach. Backend weather scoring uses mock data and works fine.

## Completed Work

See [archive/completed-2026-01.md](./archive/completed-2026-01.md) for all completed features from January 2026.
