    key: "shrine-etiquette",
    content:
      "Walk along the sides of the sando (approach path) rather than the center, which is considered the gods' pathway. The torii gate marks the transition from the secular world to sacred space — a slight bow as you pass through is a nice touch.",

  {
    id: "pt-19",

  {
    id: "pt-23",
    key: "dining-etiquette",
    content:
      "Many restaurants use ticket machines (shokkenki) at the entrance — insert money, select your dish from the buttons, and hand the ticket to the staff. Don't panic if it's all in Japanese; the top-left button is usually the house specialty.",

    key: "dining-etiquette",
    content:
      "It's perfectly fine to slurp noodles loudly in Japan — in fact, it's a sign you're enjoying the meal. When eating ramen, start with a sip of the broth, then the noodles. Lift the bowl to drink the soup; no spoon needed.",

    content:
      "Foreign tourists can get the 10% consumption tax refunded on purchases over 5,000 yen at participating stores. Bring your passport — the shop will attach a record to it. Consumables (food, cosmetics) and general goods (electronics, clothing) can be combined to hit the threshold.",

    id: "pt-26",
    key: "tax-free",
    content:
      "Tax-free items bought as consumables are sealed in a bag and technically shouldn't be opened until you leave Japan. In practice, customs rarely checks, but keep the sealed bag intact if you can. Department stores often have a dedicated tax-free counter on one floor.",

    key: "nightlife",
    content:
      "Last trains in most cities run between 11:30 PM and midnight — check your route in Google Maps or Navitime before settling into your second highball. If you miss it, taxis are safe but expensive; a manga cafe or capsule hotel makes a fun, affordable plan B.",

    key: "nightlife",
    content:
      "Many izakayas charge a small 'otoshi' (table charge) of 300-500 yen per person, which comes with a small appetizer — it's not a scam, it's standard practice. Order drinks first, food second. Sharing plates is the norm, so order a variety and pass them around.",

      "Japan's vending machines are everywhere — even on remote mountain trails. In colder months, look for red-labeled cans marked 'あたたかい' (atatakai) for hot drinks. Green tea, corn soup in a can, and hot lemon are all worth trying.",

  {
    id: "pt-30",
    key: "vending-machines",
    content:
      "Most vending machines accept IC cards and coins; some newer ones take QR payments too. Prices are standardized at around 130-160 yen for a drink, which is often cheaper than a convenience store. The Boss coffee cans are a beloved Japanese institution.",
